# Jekyll and Hide: How to work on your fastAI blog locally before deploying
To create this blog, I've been following [this fast AI blog post](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html),
which has been great for setting up and deployment. This blog post focuses on the simplicity
of updating a blog and intentionally hides the Jekyll that's under the hood.
However, sometimes you want to see your changes immediately in a testing environment
instead of having to wait for github to build and render your webpage.

Otherwise, you'll end up with a commit history similar to this:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center; width=60%;"}
 ![Commit History Image](/images/2024-04-20/commit-history.png){:width="50%"}
{: refdef}

In other words, you may want to "hide" your testing and changes before deployment.

## 0. Follow the fast AI blog post to set up your blog
You can view the blog post [here](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html).

## Install the Jekyll bundler
Get into your blog repo and install jekyll (you'll need to have ruby installed first).
```bash
bundle install
```

You will then see a ```Gemfile``` in the directory.

## Run the test server
Now that the Gemfile exists, you can run it locally as a test server by using:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, to view your blog, in your web-browser access:
```
http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Everytime save a change to your blog, you can reload the test server webpage and your
changes should be able to be synced immediately.
